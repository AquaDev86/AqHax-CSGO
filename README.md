# AqHax-CSGO

AqHax is a CSGO Hack that is written in C#. I made lots of hacks on CSGO but this time i will make a open-source one.
This hack will be made with all the knowledge i had in C# and ideas from all around GITHUB so code similarities are expected but most of the code will indeed be mine.

## Why did the project take so long ?

So guys i was very discouraged with this project and archieved it a long time ago because i literally had no time to work on it.
But now thanks to the Corona Virus i finally have time to start and finish this project once and for all.

## Roadmap
- [x] Make and implement "Visuals" tab. [ Estimated Time: 24-26 May ]
- [x] Make and implement "Aim" tab.     [ Estimated Time: 26-28 May ]
- [ ] Make and implement "Misc" tab.    [ Estimated Time: 28-30 May ]
- [ ] Make and implement "Settings" tab.[ Estimated Time: 30-01 May-Jun ]

And of course this roadmap is just the core functionalities such as (other goals are down below "*Planned Features*")
  - Wall-Hack and effects
  - Render Color Changing
  - Radar
  - Aim Hack with adjusments
  - Trigger-Bot
  - Bunny-Hop
  - Anti-Flash

# Planned Features
  - [x] An IOS UI to control the hack during a game using an IOS device. (IOS App already complete)
  - [x] Ofc a normal Windows UI for those whom doesn't own an IOS device or just not interested.
  - [ ] Maybe an in-game menu but not my main goal rn.
  - [ ] BSP Parsing would be pretty cool to achieve but im not pretty sure if i can do it.
  - [x] Aimbot with some customization.
  - [x] WallHack with some customization.
  - [ ] ESP and HealthBar (will include player name, rank, gun, etc.)
  - [ ] Bunny-Hop
  - [ ] Anti-Flash
  - [ ] Chat-bot (maybe)
  - [ ] Animated Clan Name (maybe)
  - [ ] Just a Aim-Assist to look pretty much legit (i will probably make it)

# Credits

Thanks to my friend @brtrsln, for his great icon for the program :) 

@DarcPhansea because i learned how shellcode injections work and BSP Parsing but i think i'm not gonna use it in my hack.

@frk1 because during my whole tests i used offsets from their repo(hazedumper).

@ToWhomeILearnedThings Well i don't remember all of the guys that i learned stuff (Such as SigScan) from sorry if you are not tagged.
