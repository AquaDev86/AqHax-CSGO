# AqHax-CSGO

AqHax is a CSGO Hack that is written in C#. I made lots of hacks on CSGO but this time i will make a open-source one.
This hack will be made with all the knowledge i had in C# and ideas from all around GITHUB so code similarities are expected but most of the code will indeed be mine.

# Planned Features
  - An IOS UI to control the hack using an IOS device. (Socket/TCP connection will be used to achieve this)
  - Ofc a normal Windows UI for those whom doesn't own an IOS device or just not interested.
  - Maybe an in-game menu but not my main goal rn.
  - BSP Parsing would be pretty cool to achieve but im not pretty sure if i can do it.
  - Aimbot with some customization.
  - WallHack with some customization.
  - ESP and HealthBar (will include player name, rank, gun, etc.)
  - Bunny-Hop
  - Anti-Flash
  - Chat-bot (maybe)
  - Animated Clan Name (maybe)

# Credits
@DarcPhansea because i learned how shellcode injections work and BSP Parsing but i think i'm not gonna use it in my hack.

@frk1 because during my whole tests i used offsets from their repo(hazedumper).

@ToWhomeILearnedThings Well i don't remember all of the guys that i learned stuff (Such as SigScan) from sorry if you are not tagged.
