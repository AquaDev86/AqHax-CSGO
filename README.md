# AqHax-CSGO

AqHax is a CSGO Hack that is written in C#. I made lots of hacks on CSGO but this time i will make a open-source one.
This hack supports an IOS App to be used wirelessly from your IOS Devices !
App is made by me and you can find it right here [CSGOHackGUI](https://github.com/krxdev-kaan/CSGOHackGUI/).

## Download & Setup
Just download the exe from [Releases](https://github.com/krxdev-kaan/AqHax-CSGO/releases) and launch it up.
When an update is available it will automatically prompt you to update :)
