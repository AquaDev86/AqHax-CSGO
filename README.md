# AqHax-CSGO

AqHax is a CSGO Hack that is written in C#. I made lots of hacks on CSGO but this time i will make a open-source one.
This hack will be made with all the knowledge i had in C# and ideas from all around GITHUB so code similarities are expected but most of the code will indeed be mine.

# Credits
@DarcPhansea because i learned how shellcode injections work and BSP Parsing but i think i'm not gonna use it in my hack.
@frk1 because during my whole tests i used offsets from their repo(hazedumper).
@ToWhomeILearnedThings Well i don't remember all of the guys that i learned stuff (Such as SigScan) from sorry if you are not tagged.
